Eventify - Smart Event Management for Rotaract Clubs

Overview:
Eventify is a powerful event management and registration platform tailored specifically for Rotaract Club branches. Built as a full-stack web application, Eventify streamlines the entire event lifecycle — from discovery to registration, payment, and communication — for both organizers and attendees.

Problem:
Rotaract events often suffer from fragmented tools: Google Forms for registration, Excel for tracking, separate Khalti screenshots for payments, and group chats for updates. This results in inefficiency, manual errors, and a poor experience for both clubs and participants.

Solution:
Eventify brings everything together in one unified platform. Organizers can create events, manage attendees, track payments, and send updates — all from a single dashboard. Attendees can easily browse, register, pay, and receive real-time notifications, making event participation smoother than ever.
